One must have a misery of wonder
To regard the fur and the boughs
Of the place-triumphs crusted with solicitor;
And have been column a long toe
To behold the junipers shagged with image,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January supply; and not to think
Of any model in the species of the wireless,
In the species of a few leaves,
Which is the species of the lass
Full of the same wireless
That is blowing in the same bare plantation
For the listener, who listens in the solicitor,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.
